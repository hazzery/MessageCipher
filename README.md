# AffineCipher

AffineCipher is a hobby project I started whilst studying discrete mathematics
in my first year at the University of Canterbury.
It contains code that implements the Caesar Cipher and Affine Cipher algorithms,
as well as a very basic implementation of an RSA crypto-system.

The primary purpose of displaying this project is to demonstrate my commitment
to writing code that is easily human understandable, well documented, and maintainable.

## How to run

The main.py file demonstrates very basic usage of this program.
To execute this file in a terminal, run `python main.py` inside the project directory

To instead execute the unit tests, run `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
